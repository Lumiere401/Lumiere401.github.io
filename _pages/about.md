I am a first-year Ph.D. student advised by Alexander von Humboldt Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg at University of Stuttgart, Germany. Before I started my Ph.D., I finished my master in Lund University, Sweden. My research interests include 3D Computer vision, especially how real and virtual objects can be interacted with human in VR/AR/MR.

I am currently offering several master thesis in Generative AI and VR/AR. If you are interested deeply in scientific research and want to work with me. Please check [university page](https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/team/Tian-00002/) for more information.
